# Overview

This file w2dyn/dmft/gw.py contains...
This module is intended to provide functionality related to the GW approximation. However, the current implementation is **non-functional**. The `__init__` method of the main class `GWInclusion` immediately prints a message stating "GW MODULE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN PRESENT W2DYNAMICS VERSION" and exits the program.

# Key Components

- **GWInclusion:** [Requires manual description] (This is the main class intended to handle GW calculations. Currently, its constructor exits the program.)
  - **__init__:** [Requires manual description] (Prints a message that the GW module is not available and exits.)
  - **get_GW_Sigma:** [Requires manual description] (Intended to return the GW self-energy, but currently returns 0 and would not be reached due to the `exit()` in `__init__`.)
  - **Reach_asymptotics_for_Hybridization:** [Requires manual description] (Intended to handle hybridization asymptotics, but currently returns 0 and would not be reached.)

# Important Variables/Constants

[Requires manual identification and description of important variables/constants]

# Usage Examples

[Requires manual addition of usage examples if applicable]
Currently, this module cannot be used as it will terminate the program upon instantiation of its main class.

# Dependencies and Interactions

- **numpy:** Imported as `np`.
- **scipy.optimize:** Imported as `opt`.
- **os.path:** Imported by this file.
(If functional, it would likely interact with other modules providing data like Green's functions or hybridization functions.)
