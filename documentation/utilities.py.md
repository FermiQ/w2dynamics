# Overview

This file w2dyn/auxiliaries/utilities.py contains...
This module provides miscellaneous utility functions that support other parts of the w2dynamics code, particularly the driver scripts.

# Key Components

- **decomplexify:** [Requires manual description]
- **diagonal_covariance:** [Requires manual description]

# Important Variables/Constants

[Requires manual identification and description of important variables/constants]

# Usage Examples

[Requires manual addition of usage examples if applicable]

# Dependencies and Interactions

- **numpy:** Imported as `np`.
- Likely interacts with `DistributedSample` from `w2dyn.auxiliaries.statistics` (though not explicitly imported, `diagonal_covariance` expects an object with an `apply` method and `local` attribute, characteristic of `DistributedSample`).
[Requires manual description of further interactions]
