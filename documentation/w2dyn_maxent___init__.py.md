# Overview

This file w2dyn/maxent/__init__.py contains...
This file serves as the entry point for the `w2dyn.maxent` package.
The content is a docstring that provides an overview of the modules and files within this package related to Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) analytical continuation.

It describes:
- `Makefile`: Used to compile `MaximumEntropy.F90` using `f2py`.
- `MaxEnt.py`: An interface script (likely command-line) to parse HDF5 files from w2dynamics or simple `.dat` files for the MaxEnt solver. It details the expected format for `.dat` files.
- `Solver.py`: Contains a base class and derived classes (`Green2Aw`, `Chi2Aw`) that wrap the MaxEnt Fortran solver, providing default parameters.
- `MaximumEntropy.F90`: The core Fortran code for the Maximum Entropy method.
- `MersenneTwister.F90`: A Fortran implementation of the Mersenne Twister random number generator, with a note about its [0,1] closed interval behavior.

# Key Components

- No functional Python code (classes, functions, or variables) is defined in this `__init__.py` file. Its primary purpose is to mark the `maxent` directory as a Python package and to provide the descriptive docstring.

# Important Variables/Constants

[Requires manual identification and description of important variables/constants]

# Usage Examples

[Requires manual addition of usage examples if applicable]

# Dependencies and Interactions

- This file itself does not have explicit import dependencies as it contains no executable code beyond the docstring.
- As a package initializer, it enables the import of other modules within the `w2dyn.maxent` package (e.g., `Solver`, `SigmaBootStrap`).
- It implies a dependency on a compiled Fortran library (from `MaximumEntropy.F90` and `MersenneTwister.F90`) for the MaxEnt calculations to function.
[Requires manual description of further interactions]
