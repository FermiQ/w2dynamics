# Overview

This file w2dyn/dmft/doublecounting.py contains...
This module defines various classes for handling double-counting corrections in DMFT calculations. Double-counting corrections are necessary to avoid counting electron-electron interactions twice, once in the simplified LDA (or similar) band structure and again in the more accurate impurity model.

The module provides a base class `DoubleCounting` and several derived classes implementing different double-counting schemes:
- `Zero`: A trivial correction that is always zero.
- `UserSupplied`: Allows the user to provide the double-counting correction directly.
- `ShellAveraged`: A base class for schemes that average interactions and fillings over l-subshells.
  - `FullyLocalisedLimit` (FLL or Anisimov's): Assumes the non-interacting problem represents the atomic limit.
  - `AroundMeanField` (AMF): A correction to FLL for systems away from half-filling.
- `SelfConsistent`: A base class for schemes that determine the double-counting self-consistently.
  - `SigZeroBar`: Uses the real part of the self-energy at the lowest Matsubara frequency.
  - `SigInfBar`: Uses the zeroth moment (high-frequency limit) of the self-energy.
  - `Trace`: Adjusts the double-counting based on the trace of the Green's function and occupation numbers.
- `Fixed_dp_Distance`: An experimental method to fix the energy distance between certain d and p orbitals.
