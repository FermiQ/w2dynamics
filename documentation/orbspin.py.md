# Overview

This file w2dyn/dmft/orbspin.py contains...
This module provides a collection of utility functions for working with multi-dimensional arrays that have orbital and spin indices, common in many-body physics calculations. These functions help in checking array properties, manipulating diagonals, performing inversions, and symmetrizing arrays.

# Key Components

- **allzeros:** [Requires manual description] (Checks if all elements in an array are close to zero within a tolerance.)
- **is_spindiagonal:** [Requires manual description] (Checks if an array is diagonal in its spin indices.)
- **is_paramag:** [Requires manual description] (Checks if an array represents a paramagnetic state, i.e., spin-up and spin-down components are similar.)
- **is_diagonal:** [Requires manual description] (Checks if an array is diagonal in both band and spin indices, effectively checking if it's diagonal in the combined flavor index.)
- **set_diagonal:** [Requires manual description] (Sets the diagonal elements of an array (combined band/spin diagonal).)
- **promote_diagonal:** [Requires manual description] (Takes a diagonal array (band, spin) and constructs a full matrix (band, spin, band, spin) with these values on the diagonal.)
- **extract_diagonal:** [Requires manual description] (Extracts the diagonal elements (combined band/spin) from a full matrix.)
- **trace:** [Requires manual description] (Calculates the trace over the band and spin indices.)
- **warn_offdiagonal:** [Requires manual description] (Checks for significant off-diagonal elements and issues a warning if found.)
- **invert:** [Requires manual description] (Performs matrix inversion over the combined band/spin indices for each leading dimension (e.g., frequency).)
- **diag_invert:** [Requires manual description] (Performs inversion for an array that is already known to be band/spin-diagonal.)
- **symm_spins:** [Requires manual description] (Symmetrizes a Hermitian array over its spin dimensions.)
- **multiply:** [Requires manual description] (Multiplies two arrays (e.g., Green's functions or self-energies) over their orbital/spin dimensions for each leading dimension (e.g., frequency).)

# Important Variables/Constants

- **STD_TOL:** A standard tolerance value (1e-8) used for floating-point comparisons in several functions.
[Requires manual identification and description of important variables/constants]

# Usage Examples

[Requires manual addition of usage examples if applicable]

# Dependencies and Interactions

- **warnings:** Specifically `warn` is used by `warn_offdiagonal`.
- **numpy:** Imported as `np`. This is the primary dependency for array manipulations.
- **. _compat:** Imported as `_linalg`. This local module provides compatibility wrappers for NumPy linear algebra functions (like `inv`) for older NumPy versions.
[Requires manual description of further interactions]
