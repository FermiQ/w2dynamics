# Overview

This file src/ctqmc_fortran/CompoundIndex.F90 contains...
This Fortran module, `MCompoundIndex`, provides subroutines to convert between a single compound flavor index and a more detailed band-spin pattern for an arbitrary number of operators `N`. It facilitates a one-to-one mapping given the number of bands (`Nbands`). This is useful for indexing and managing multi-orbital and multi-spin states or Green's function components.

# Key Components

- **MODULE MCompoundIndex:** [Requires manual description]
  - **SUBROUTINE index2component_general:** [Requires manual description] (Converts a single compound index `ind` into a band-spin pattern represented by arrays `bs` (band-spin combined), `b` (bands), and `s` (spins).)
  - **SUBROUTINE component2index_general:** [Requires manual description] (Converts a band-spin pattern (arrays `b` and `s`) into a single compound index `ind`. It also outputs the combined `bs` array.)
- **PROGRAM CompoundIndex:** [Requires manual description] (A test program included if `CompoundIndex_Test` is defined. It tests the forward and backward conversion for a given `Nbands` and `N`.)

# Important Variables/Constants

[Requires manual identification and description of important variables/constants/common blocks]

# Usage Examples

[Requires manual addition of usage examples if applicable]

# Dependencies and Interactions

- This module does not `USE` any other custom modules but relies on intrinsic Fortran functions.
- It is likely used by other parts of the CTQMC code that need to map between a flat index and structured (band, spin) indices for operators or matrix elements.
[Requires manual description of further interactions]
