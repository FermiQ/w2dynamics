# Overview

This file w2dyn/dmft/dynamicalU.py contains...
This module is intended to implement the transformation of retarded density-density interactions into a shift of instantaneous potentials and a modification of fermion operator weights. However, the current implementation is **non-functional** as the `__init__` method of the main class immediately prints a message stating "U(w) MODULE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN PRESENT W2DYNAMICS VERSION" and exits the program.

The docstring mentions a derivation for this implementation (link provided, though potentially with limited access) and includes `FIXME` comments regarding limitations if it were functional (e.g., expected to be used with `ReadUmatrix` Hamiltonian option and potential issues if only some bands have retarded interactions).

# Key Components

- **Replace_Retarded_Interaction_by_a_Shift_of_instantaneous_Potentials:** [Requires manual description] (This is the main class intended to handle the transformation. Currently, its constructor exits the program.)
  - **__init__:** [Requires manual description] (Prints a message that the U(w) module is not available and exits.)

# Important Variables/Constants

[Requires manual identification and description of important variables/constants]

# Usage Examples

[Requires manual addition of usage examples if applicable]
Currently, this module cannot be used as it will terminate the program upon instantiation of its main class.

# Dependencies and Interactions

- **numpy:** Imported as `np`.
- **os:** Imported by this file.
(If functional, it would likely interact with modules handling the U-matrix and Hamiltonian setup.)
[Requires manual description of further interactions]
