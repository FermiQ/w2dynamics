# Overview

This file w2dyn/maxent/SigmaBootStrap.py contains...
This script is designed to generate bootstrap error estimates for various quantities (like self-energy `siw`, Green's functions `gtau`, `giw`) stored in w2dynamics HDF5 output files. The script reads data from specified DMFT or statistical iterations, performs bootstrap resampling using the `scikits.bootstrap` library, and writes the mean values along with their bootstrap error bars into plain text files. These text files can then be used as input for subsequent analytical continuation procedures, for example, with `MaxEnt.py`.

The script uses `multiprocessing` to parallelize the bootstrap calculations for different frequency/time points.

# Key Components

- **ci_eval:** [Requires manual description] (A function that takes a sample of data points and calculates the confidence interval (error bar) using bootstrap resampling via `scikits.bootstrap.ci`.)
- **Enumerator:** [Requires manual description] (A simple class that acts like an enumerator, returning the integer index passed to `__getitem__`. Used as a fallback for x-axis values if the quantity tag is not recognized for standard frequency/time axes.)
- **main script execution block (`if __name__ == '__main__':`)**
    - Parses command-line options (HDF5 file(s), quantity tag, iteration ranges, filter file).
    - Iterates through each input HDF5 file.
    - Determines the number of DMFT and statistical steps available.
    - Applies filtering of iterations if a filter file is provided.
    - Determines the appropriate x-axis (frequency or time) based on the quantity tag.
    - Loops over inequivalent sites (`NIneqs`).
    - For each site and each component (band/spin indices) of the selected quantity:
        - Collects samples from the specified iterations.
        - Calculates the mean of the samples.
        - Uses a multiprocessing `Pool` to call `ci_eval` in parallel for each frequency/time point to get bootstrap errors.
        - Writes the x-axis value, mean real part, mean imaginary part (if applicable), and bootstrap error to an output text file.

# Important Variables/Constants

- **__version__:** Script version, set to `(1, 0)`.
[Requires manual identification and description of important variables/constants]

# Usage Examples

[Requires manual addition of usage examples if applicable]
This is a command-line script. Example usage:
```bash
python SigmaBootStrap.py --quantity siw --dmft-steps-begin 10 --dmft-steps-end 20 my_output.hdf5
```
This would process `my_output.hdf5`, extract the `siw` quantity from DMFT iterations 10 to 20, calculate bootstrap errors, and save results to files like `siw_0_0_0.dat` etc.

# Dependencies and Interactions

- **numpy:** Imported as `np`.
- **h5py:** Imported as `hdf5` for reading HDF5 files.
- **sys:** Imported by this file.
- **optparse:** Used for command-line option parsing.
- **multiprocessing:** Specifically `Pool` and `cpu_count` are used for parallelization.
- **auxiliaries.quantities:** Imported as `qttys` (likely from `w2dyn.auxiliaries.quantities`). This is used to read specific quantities from the HDF5 file.
- **scikits.bootstrap:** Imported as `boot`. This is the core library used for bootstrap error estimation.
